      "letter": "Hi LegendsLab Team,\n\nI have a track-record of building AI-driven applications for over 5 years, which is why I believe I can provide the support you need.\n\nA few highlights of my skills:\n\n- Proficiency in building agentic AI applications using LLMs and RAGs\n- Experience with Microservices Architecture\n- Years of experience in frontend development (mainly React)\n- Expertise in backend development (Python or Node.js)\n- Experience in MLOps\n- Leadership experience\n\nHere are some relevant project examples I want to showcase:\n\n1. I worked as a Data Scientist for a fintech startup in Germany, where I optimized ETL pipelines and reduced cloud costs by 90%. I also developed an agentic chatbot for customer support to cut operations by 70%. I worked across multiple departments, learning about the different priorities of each key decision-maker and consolidated the knowledge to provide custom solutions.\n\n2. Another notable example is the development of a remote robot operation app. Together with managers and hardware engineers I strategized and implemented a system that handles seemless machine control. I handled the frontend and backend implementation that enables users to issue commands to the robot and program sequences that are tracked with computer vision algorithms. I handled the evaluation of the computer vision performance with MLOps methodologies to ensure high accuracy in production.\n\nWith a proven track record of delivering results-driven AI software solutions, I can bring significant value to your project. Additionally, my year-long experience in mentoring will allow me to effectively communicate technical concepts to stakeholders.\n\nI'm keen to explore how I can contribute to your project's success. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss the details!\n\nBest Regards,\nJulien"
