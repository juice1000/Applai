      "letter": "Hi LegendsLab Team,\n\nI have a track record of building AI driven applications for over 5 years, and I believe my experience can help you reach your goals!\n\nA few highlights of my skills:\n- Proficiency in building agentic AI applications using LLMs and RAGs\n- Experience with Microservices Architecture\n- Extensive experience in frontend development (mainly React)\n- Expertise in backend development with Python or Node.js\n- Hands on experience in MLOps\n- Leadership skills\n\nSome project examples:\n1. I worked as a Data Scientist at a fintech startup in Germany, where I optimized ETL pipelines and reduced cloud costs by 90%. I also developed an agentic chatbot for customer support, which cut operational costs by 70%. I collaborated with different departments and learned the priorities of each decision maker to provide custom solutions.\n2. I developed a remote robot operation app together with managers and hardware engineers. I strategized and implemented a system that allows seamless machine control. I managed both frontend and backend development, enabling users to issue commands to the robot and program sequences tracked with computer vision algorithms. I also evaluated the performance of computer vision using MLOps methods to ensure high accuracy in production.\n\nI have a proven track record of delivering results-driven AI software solutions. I also have years of mentoring experience, which helps me explain technical concepts clearly to stakeholders.\n\nLooking forward to discuss how I can contribute to your project's success. Let's schedule a meeting soon!\n\nBest regards,\nJulien"
